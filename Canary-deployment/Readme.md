# Canary Deployment Strategy
+ A Canary Deployment in Kubernetes is a strategy where a new version of an app is released to a small group of users first. If it works well, it’s gradually rolled out to everyone. This helps reduce the risk of issues affecting all users.

## How it works ?

+ Deploy New Version (Canary Release):
  + The new version of the application is first deployed to a small subset of users or a specific group of pods, called the canary.
  + This is typically a small fraction of the total traffic, so the new version gets tested by a limited audience while the majority of users continue to use the stable, old version.
 
+ Traffic Splitting:
  + The traffic is split between the old version (the stable version) and the new version (the canary version).
  + Initially, a small percentage (e.g., 5–10%) of the traffic is routed to the new canary version, and the rest continues to go to the old version.
 
+ Monitor and Analyze:
  + While the canary version is live, you monitor it for any errors or issues (like crashes, performance problems, etc.).

+ Gradual Rollout:
  + If the canary version performs well, the percentage of traffic routed to the canary version is gradually increased.
  + This can be done in stages, such as 10%, 25%, 50%, and then 100%, depending on how confident you are with the new release.
  + The gradual increase reduces the risk of impacting all users if something goes wrong with the new version.
